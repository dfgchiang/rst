title: "Stat 128 Week 9 Class R Notebook"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
mydata <- c(3,8,7,6,3,2,9,10)
?sample
set.seed(33)
bs1 <- sample(mydata, size=length(mydata), replace = TRUE)
bs1
bs2 <- sample(mydata, size=length(mydata), replace = TRUE)
bs2

```
## Bootstrap

Bootstrap = construct some more data from what we have;
to simulate more sample from what we have;
to avoid overfitting if there is a weird observation

## Random Forest

Random Forest = a forest of trees from random samples

```{r}
library(randomForest)
library(MASS)
View(Pima.tr)

```

When you draw a bootstrap sample about 1/3 is left out of sample;
so those become your test data.
Bag error is the error from running all the sample 
through the treesleft out

```{r}
set.seed(387)
pimaforest <- randomForest(type~., data = Pima.tr)
pimaforest
str(pimaforest)
head(pimaforest$err.rate[,1])
plot(pimaforest$err.rate[,1], type='l')

```

mtry = tuning parameter; default is not always the best;
use loop to run different mtry values

```{r}
oob.error <- numeric(7)
for (i in 1:7){
  forest2 <- randomForest(type~., data = Pima.tr, mtry = i, ntree = 300)
  oob.error[i] <- forest2$err.rate[300,1]
  #test.set.error[i] <- sum(preds != Pima.te, )
}
oob.error
importance(pimaforest)
varImpPlot(pimaforest)

```
