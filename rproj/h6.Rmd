## 1.a Probability of left handed people in 30 random selection 
```{r}
h61a <- dbinom(x = 5, size = 30, prob = 0.10)
h61a

```

## 1.b Calculate prob distrib of lefties
```{r}
h61b <- pbinom(q = 5, size = 30, prob = 0.10)
h61b
```

```{r}
pd <- c(NA)
for (i in 1:30) {
  pd[i] <- pbinom(i, size = 30, prob = 0.10)
}
pd
```

## 1.c. Graph of Prob Distrib from part b
```{r}
plot(pd, type = 'h')
```

## 1.d. Prob 3 desks in classroom that holds 30 will be enough
```{r}
h61d <- pbinom(3, size = 30, prob = 0.10)
h61d #= 0.6474392
```
